One of my first few Data Analytic projects using Python. The libraries I used were Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Codecs, and Seaborn.

I answered the following questions:
What is the correlation between Life Ladder and the various other survey responses? Strong correlation
What is the correlation between GDP and Life Expectancy? Higher GDP generally means higher life expectancy
What is the correlation between Corruption and Freedom? Higher Corruption equates to less freedom in most circumstances
What is the correlation between Social support and generosity? More social support means less generosity is needed
What is the correlation between Social support and life expectancy? Strong positive correlation between social support and life expectancy.
What regions are happiest? Wester Europe and North America and ANZ have the highest happiness, with Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia having the lowest. Overall happiness doesnt seem to change too much from region to region.
What regions have the highest GDP and life expectancy? Middle East and North Africa, North America and ANZ, Carribean and Latin America. 
How do these correlations play out when compared against different regions? It appears that regions with more of the positive variables and less of the negatives have a higher happiness score. This isnt shocking, and nothing too interesting was learned from this, but the goal for me was to practice.
